<h2>About</h2>

<p>Windows Master is primarily a window management application. It is certainly not the first of its kind. A few other notable window managing applications include: Display Fusion, WinSplit, and WindowPad.</p>

<p>All three applications have notable features. WinSplit pioneered the idea of <a href="Sequencing.html">sequencing</a>. Display Fusion is similar but has an arguably overwhelming number of actions that must be configured. Finally, WindowPad is a hybrid of the two, but it is developer-friendly instead of user-friendly.</p>

<p>Windows Master is an augmentation of all three applications. The most noteworthy feature is the utilization of the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion Controller</a>. This brings an immersive experience where you may control your computer by simply a wave of your hand. Other notable features include: utilization of <a href="Sequencing.html"> sequencing</a>, <a href="Multi_Monitor_Info.html">orderly window movement</a>, <a href="Snapping.html">window snapping</a> (or anchoring), and also a handy <a href="Quick_Menu.html">quick menu</a> to give instant access to numerous window functions.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>There's a key principle used throughout Windows Master that should be understood. Namely, the context for a given action is the <i>currently active window</i> -- that means the <i>one</i> window which is currently focused; furthermore, each action is monitor-sensitive. For example, <i>Snap to Center</i> will center the <i>active window</i> within the monitor the window is currently on. For more information, refer to the list at the bottom of this document.</p>
<p>When Windows Master is initially launched, the following view is displayed:

<p>Every action in Windows Master may be mapped to a hotkey and/or a Leap Motion gesture. Notice the tabs on the left: Sequencing, Resizing, Snapping, Other Actions, and Leap. These are categories for actions within Windows Master. Below are links with explanations for each tab, how they work, and how to configure them.</p>
