<p class=rvps101>Windows Master is primarily a window management application. It is certainly not the first of its kind. A few other notable window managing applications include: Display Fusion, WinSplit, and WindowPad.</p>
<p class=rvps101><br></p>
<p class=rvps101>All three applications have notable features. WinSplit pioneered the idea of <a class=rvts102 href="Sequencing.html">sequencing</a>. Display Fusion takes an aggressive approach of putting <i>many</i> options in the hands of the user, the most noteworthy feature possibly being <a class=rvts102 href="Orderly_Window_Movement.html">ordered window movement</a>. Finally, WindowPad shares some of those same features, but it is developer-friendly instead of user-friendly.</p>
<p class=rvps101><br></p>
<p class=rvps101>Windows Master is an augmentation of all three applications. The most noteworthy feature is the utilization of the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap(™) Motion Controller</a>. This brings the immersive experience where you may control your computer with simply a wave of your hand. Other notable features include: utilization of sequencing, ordered window movement, window snapping (or <a class=rvts103 href="Snapping.html">anchoring</a>), and also a handy <a class=rvts103 href="Quick_Menu.html">quick menu</a> to give instant access to numerous window functions.</p>
<p class=rvps101>Every action in Windows Master may be mapped to a hotkey, and/or a Leap(™) Motion gesture. For more information on how to perform gestures, see <a href="Performing_Gestures.html">Performing Gestures</a></p>
