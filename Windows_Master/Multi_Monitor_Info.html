<h2>Multi-monitor support</h2>

<p>Windows Master seamlessly supports multi-monitor configurations such as the one shown below. Each action within Windows Master is monitor-sensitive. For example, <i>Snap to Center</i> will center the <i>active window</i> within the monitor the window is currently on.</p>

<h3>Orderly Window Movement</h3>
<p>It is imperative for a program like Windows Master to have a way to move windows from one monitor to another. Windows Master provides this through the <i>Window to Left Monitor</i> and <i>Window to Right Monitor</i> actions. The problem with most programs is that these actions do not always move the window to the monitor that is physically located to the left or right.</p>
<p style="text-indent:25px;"><i>Note: Window to Left Monitor and Window to Right Monitor are located in the <a href="Other_Actions.html">Other Actions</a> tab within Windows Master.</i></p>
<p>Windows Master truly does move the windows between monitors based upon physical location. It does so by ordering monitors where #1 is the bottom-left monitor and the last monitor is at the top-right. If monitors are stacked, such as in the screenshot below, Windows Master "wraps" the window between the top and bottom monitors from in order from left to right.</p>
<p>For example, if the monitor is on #1 and the <i>Window to Left Monitor</i> action is invoked, then the window is placed on monitor #6. If the monitor is on #3 <i>Window to Right Monitor</i> action is invoked, then the window is placed on monitor #4. Finally, if the monitor is on #6 <i>Window to Right Monitor</i> action is invoked, then the window is placed on monitor #1. In this way, windows are "wrapped" between monitors.</p>
